# Jira Backlog Planning File Instructions

## Purpose and Scope

Templates, field conventions, Jira command references, and state persistence rules for Jira backlog planning files. Workflow files consume this specification by including a cross-reference at the top of their content.

Cross-reference pattern for consuming files:

```markdown
Follow all instructions from #file:./jira-backlog-planning.instructions.md while executing this workflow.
```

Inline reference pattern when citing specific sections:

```markdown
per templates in #file:./jira-backlog-planning.instructions.md
using the matrix from #file:./jira-backlog-planning.instructions.md
```

## Jira Command Catalog

Use the Jira skill through `.github/skills/jira/jira/scripts/jira.py`.

### Discovery and Retrieval

* `search`: Search for issues with bounded JQL. Key parameters: `'<jql>'`, optional `max_results`, optional `--fields`.
* `get`: Read one issue with an explicit field list. Key parameters: `<ISSUE-KEY>`, optional `--fields`.
* `comments`: Retrieve comments for one or more issues. Key parameters: `<ISSUE-KEY> [ISSUE-KEY ...]`, optional `--fields`.
* `fields`: Discover issue types for a project or required create fields for a specific issue type. Key parameters: `<PROJECT-KEY> [issue-type-id]`.

### Creation and Updates

* `create`: Create an issue from a JSON payload. Key parameters: JSON on stdin or as an argument.
* `update`: Update an issue from a JSON payload. Key parameters: `<ISSUE-KEY>`, JSON on stdin or as an argument.
* `transition`: Move an issue to a new status by transition name or ID. Key parameters: `<ISSUE-KEY>`, `<transition-name-or-id>`.
* `comment`: Add a comment to an issue. Key parameters: `<ISSUE-KEY>`, comment body on stdin or as an argument.

## Planning File Definitions and Directory Conventions

Root planning workspace structure:

```text
.copilot-tracking/
  jira-issues/
    <planning-type>/
      <scope-name>/
        issue-analysis.md
        issues-plan.md
        planning-log.md
        handoff.md
        handoff-logs.md
```

Valid `<planning-type>` values:

* `discovery`: Issue discovery from artifacts, requirements, or search scopes
* `triage`: Issue triage, field cleanup, duplicate review, and workflow-state recommendations
* `execution`: Issue creation, update, transition, and comment processing from finalized plans

Normalization rules for `<scope-name>`:

* Use lower-case, hyphenated form without extension.
* Replace spaces and punctuation with hyphens.
* Choose the primary artifact when multiple documents are provided.
* For triage scopes, use the date as the scope name.
* For execution scopes, use the date as the scope name unless the handoff file already defines a clearer slug.

## Planning File Requirements

Planning markdown files must start with:

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-disable-file -->
<!-- markdown-table-prettify-ignore-start -->
```

Planning markdown files must end with:

```markdown
<!-- markdown-table-prettify-ignore-end -->
```

## Planning File Templates

### issue-analysis.md

Use `issue-analysis.md` when discovery starts from documents or user-provided requirements. The file captures evolving human-readable analysis before finalizing `issues-plan.md`.

## Similarity Assessment Framework

Classify candidate-to-existing-issue comparisons using these categories:

| Category  | Meaning                                                                              |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Match     | Existing issue already covers the requirement with minor or no edits                 |
| Similar   | Existing issue overlaps but requires user review to decide whether to merge or split |
| Distinct  | Existing issue does not cover the requirement                                        |
| Uncertain | Available evidence is insufficient for a confident decision                          |

Assess similarity using summary overlap, issue type compatibility, status, labels, and requirement coverage from the source artifact.

## Jira Field Guidance

Prefer these fields for MVP planning when available:

| Field         | Use                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| `project`     | Required for create operations      |
| `summary`     | Required for create operations      |
| `issuetype`   | Required for create operations      |
| `description` | Primary body content                |
| `labels`      | Lightweight categorization          |
| `priority`    | Triage and execution prioritization |
| `assignee`    | Optional ownership assignment       |

Call `fields` before creating issues when the project or issue type is not already validated in the plan.

## Content Sanitization Guards

Before sending text to Jira through `create`, `update`, or `comment`:

* Remove `.copilot-tracking/` paths and local planning file references.
* Remove planning reference IDs such as `JI001` unless the user explicitly wants them preserved in Jira.
* Replace unresolved `{{TEMP-N}}` placeholders with descriptive text when a Jira comment is being posted before the create step has run.
* Keep committed repository file paths only when they are useful to the user and safe to expose in Jira.

## Three-Tier Autonomy Model

| Mode              | Behavior                                                                                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Full              | Execute all supported Jira operations without confirmation                                           |
| Partial (default) | Auto-execute low-risk field updates, but gate creates, transitions, and ambiguous duplicate handling |
| Manual            | Require confirmation for every Jira mutation                                                         |

## State Persistence Protocol

When a conversation resumes after summarization or interruption:

1. Read `planning-log.md` first.
2. If execution has started, read `handoff.md` and `handoff-logs.md`.
3. Rebuild any `{{TEMP-N}}` mappings from `handoff-logs.md` before continuing.
4. Continue from the first unchecked or unlogged operation.

## Human Review Triggers

Pause and ask for guidance when:

* The project key or issue type for a planned create is still unknown.
* Similarity assessment returns Uncertain.
* Multiple existing issues are Similar matches for one candidate.
* A transition target is not available for the issue.
* A create or update would touch fields not covered by the validated field payload.
