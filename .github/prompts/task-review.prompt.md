# Task Review

## Inputs

* ${input:chat:true}: (Optional, defaults to true) Include conversation context for review analysis.
* ${input:plan}: (Optional) Implementation plan file path.
* ${input:changes}: (Optional) Changes log file path.
* ${input:research}: (Optional) Research file path.
* ${input:scope}: (Optional) Time-based scope such as "today", "this week", or "since last review".

## Requirements

1. Resolve review scope using this priority: explicitly provided inputs, attached or open files, time-based scope from `${input:scope}`, then artifacts since the last review log.
2. When `${input:chat}` is true, extract artifact references and context from the conversation history.
3. Summarize findings with severity counts, review log path, and recommended next steps.
