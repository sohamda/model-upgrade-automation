# Triage ADO Work Items

Fetch work items in `New` state with incomplete classification, analyze each for field recommendations, detect duplicates, and produce a triage plan for review before execution.

Follow all instructions from #file:../../instructions/ado/ado-backlog-triage.instructions.md while executing this workflow.
Follow all instructions from #file:../../instructions/ado/ado-wit-planning.instructions.md for shared conventions, planning file templates, and field definitions.
