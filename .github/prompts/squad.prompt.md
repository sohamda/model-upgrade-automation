# Squad

## Inputs

* ${input:request}: (Required) The work for the squad this turn, from the user prompt or conversation.
* ${input:profile}: (Optional) The squad profile to seed when the project has no squad yet (`default`, `full`, `security`, `design`, `architecture`, `azure`, or `product`). Selects which cast the coordinator stamps out during Init Mode.
* ${input:tier}: (Optional) A model-tier hint (`fast` or `default`) that overrides the coordinator's cost-first defaults for this turn.
* ${input:owner}: (Optional) A `Member Name` from `team.md` that picks a specific named member when two rows share the same `Role` (for example, `owner=Beta` when both `developer` rows exist as `Beta` and `Gamma`).
* ${input:mode}: (Optional) The autonomy mode for this turn. `autonomous` engages the bounded `auto-validated` validator loop from `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autonomous.instructions.md`. `autopilot` runs the full research→plan→implement→review pipeline from `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`, stopping for the human only at impactful actions and final-outcome validation. When omitted, the coordinator uses the standard interactive `auto` and `confirm` tiers from the routing table, approving each step.

## Requirements

1. Hand `${input:request}` (and `${input:owner}` when provided) to the Squad Coordinator and let its per-turn protocol classify, dispatch, and synthesize the response.
2. Pass `${input:profile}` through as the Init Mode profile hint when provided; when the project has no squad and no profile is given, let the coordinator discover the project and propose a recommended profile before seeding.
3. Pass `${input:tier}` through as the per-turn tier override when provided; otherwise leave cost-first model selection to the coordinator.
4. When `${input:mode}` is `autonomous`, request the coordinator engage the `auto-validated` tier per `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autonomous.instructions.md` (capped re-validation loop, always-escalate triggers); when `${input:mode}` is `autopilot`, request the coordinator run the full pipeline per `.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md` (Human Gates on impactful actions and final-outcome validation only); otherwise rely on the standard interactive `auto` and `confirm` tiers from the routing table.
5. Let the coordinator own roster, routing, state, and the notification contract; it reads `.copilot-tracking/squad/{team.md,routing.md,state.json}`, seeds them on first run through Init Mode (including capturing an optional notification email per `.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`), and persists decisions, history, and notifications through the Squad Scribe.
