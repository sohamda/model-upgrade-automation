# Pull Request

## Inputs

* ${input:branch:origin/main}: (Optional, defaults to origin/main) Base branch reference for diff generation
* ${input:createPullRequest:false}: (Optional, determined through conversation provided by user) When true, then explicitly include following instructions for creating pull request with MCP tools.
* ${input:excludeMarkdown:false}: (Optional) When true, exclude markdown diffs from pr-reference generation

## Requirements

Read and follow all instructions from #file:../../instructions/hve-core/pull-request.instructions.md to generate a pull request body of changes using the pr-reference Skill with parallel subagent review.

Before producing `.copilot-tracking/pr/pr.md` or creating a pull request, search for and apply `content-policy-citation.instructions.md`.

Generate a new pr.md file following the pull-request instructions.

* Analyzes branch diffs against the base branch and reviews changes using parallel subagents.
* Produces `.copilot-tracking/pr/pr.md` with the final PR description, along with temporary analysis artifacts in `.copilot-tracking/pr/subagents/`.
* Creates a pull request via MCP tools when explicitly requested.
